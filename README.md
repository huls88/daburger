How It Works

Type the name of any hamburger you can imagine in the Add a Burger form.
Click the Eat It button next to a burger in the Ready to Eat column.
Watch as the burger you selected magically moves to the Already Eaten column.
I know, I know. It's mind-blowing.



There's a bunch of stuff going on behind the scenes that makes this project interesting (to me, at least).

Built around a bona-fide MVC architecture
Templating with Handlebars
CSS built with SASS (using Gulp for preprocessing)
Custom-built ORM for MySQL database interaction
Deployed via Heroku
